# Use React Context to create and expose an API for your components



## Plan
* Great design system are based on a consistency built through components
* What consistency is
* Show the example of the two dropdowns
* Explain that visually, those two are quite the same, but the second one has different behavior
* Show how the component Dropdown is designed and that we cannot in its instance manipulate if the component should open or close

* Introduction to context
* Show that we can passe through context functions
* Use the context provider to access those functions
* Problem solved
* Opening about how presentation component with high interactive value (Tabs, Accordions, Dropdowns, Carousels, Modal, Popovers, Alerts) we can now expose bunch of method to manipulate them. And this allow thoses components to be more flexible about their behavior and fit more specific usage without sacrifice consistency.
